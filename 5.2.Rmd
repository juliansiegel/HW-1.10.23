1) 
``` {r 1.1}
filter(flights, (arr_delay > 120))
```

2)
```{r 1.2}
filter(flights, dest %in% c("IAH","HOU"))
```

3)
```{r 1.3}
unique(flights$carrier)
filter(flights, carrier %in% c("UA", "AA", "DL"))
```

4)
```{r 1.4}
filter(flights,month %in% c(7,8,9))
```

5)
```{r 1.5}
filter(flights, (arr_delay > 120 | dep_delay <= 15))
```

6)
```{r 1.6}
filter(flights,dep_delay >60,arr_delay<dep_delay-30)
```
7)
```{r 1.7}
filter(flights,dep_time>=0,dep_time<=0600)
```
##### 2)
The between function can help simpilfy when we are using inequalities.For example, this could have been used for question 1.7 to simplify the time frame we were talking about.

##### 3)
```{r 3}
filter(flights,is.na(dep_time))
```
8255 flights were missing departure times. These also had no delay or arrival. My guess it that these flights were cancelled.
